## Habit Tracker

### Features

1. Add a habit:
   * Create a "+" icon or a "Add a new habit" button on the habit listing/ landing page which will open a dialog box kind of component with different text boxes for the details of the habit.
   * These text boxes will ask for the details, like the Name of the habit, the Goal of the habit, How many times do you want to perform the habit & what would be the start date.
2. Habit Listing Page
   * The user should be able to see the list of all habits created on a habit listing/ landing page.
3. If the user clicks on any particular habit, a modal should open to edit the habit.
4. Edit/Delete/Archive a habit
   * Edit:
     - I can see an "edit" option to edit the details of the habit that were entered earlier.
   * Delete:
     -  I can see a "trash" icon or "delete" button to delete the habits.
   * Archive:
     - I can see an archive button that would archive a habit and that habit would show up on the archive page and get removed from the landing page.
